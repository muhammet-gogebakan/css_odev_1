            We are believers in free and equal access to opportunities for everyone... and we execute our dreams.
<br> Imagine a train-then-hire platform connected to hundreds of companies around the world. Moving talented people from training straight to jobs.

<br> Patika is this platform that millions of youth and companies have been imagining for years, but schools failed to deliver.

<br> We are here to change it. </p><br>
        <p>Our story
<br>            Patika is the product of friendships going back to 2007 and a team dedicated to solving problems in education.
            
<br>            Our founding team has led some of the most influential tech education nonprofits in the US and Turkey before starting Patika.
            
<br>            In March 2021, we set up Patika to do the obvious: Human capital is the most important resource for companies, so we need to help them create their own human capital - when providing great job opportunities for everyone.
